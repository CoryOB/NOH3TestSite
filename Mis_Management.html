                        <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Grand Master : </h2>
                        <p class="text-white-50">The head hasher. The chairman of the board. The big cheese. The HMFIC. 
                            The guiding light. Gispert’s legacy. The GM is not simply a figure head for the hash, rather (s)he personifies the hash’s 
                            character (or lack thereof.) (S)he leads with a dynamic strength that permeates the fabric of the organization. Both directly, 
                            and through the hash officers, (s)he gives inspiration, direction, and vision to all. This position ranks only below Beermeister, 
                            Songmeister, Hash Cash, Hash Flash, and Public Exposer/Shit Talker in real importance to the hash.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-white mb-4">On-Sec : </h2>
                        <p class="text-white-50">Demi-god record keeper for the kennel.  In the Sacred Book of the Hash, records who came at each trail and who hared the trail.
                            Obsesses over spreadsheets. Has OCD, or rather, CDO – with the letters in correct alphabetical order.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Religious Advisor : </h2>
                        <p class="text-white-50">(also known as the RA) Keeper of the faith and sacred Laws of Hashing. Enforcer of the scriptures. 
                            This is the hasher who has seen the light (Bud light) and can taste in his soul the true spirit of Hashing. The religious advisor 
                            spreads the word and inspires the zest and zeal of the hash in all participants. It is the job of the Religious Advisor to run 
                            circle. (S)he are responsible for leading us in song as well as making sure that violators of hash traditions are punished with 
                            down-downs. (S)he comes up with sufficiently plausible lies to cover any serious questions of propriety of actions within the hash. 
                            It is best to avoid eye contact with them during circle.</p>
                        <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Hare Raiser : </h2>
                        <p class="text-white-50">The Hare Raiser makes sure that there’s a hare (or hares) for each hash, and that the start location is 
                            known to the Public Exposer/Shit Talker well in advance of hash day for publicity purposes. As hare raiser, (s)he is responsible 
                            for helping to train new hares to lay trail properly. The Hare Raiser IS the hare if (s)he can’t find anyone else to do it.</p>
                        <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Haberdasher : </h2>
                        <p class="text-white-50">This is a person who has a flair for fashion, a head for business (who said head?), and the showmanship of 
                            P.T. Barnum. (S)he’s responsible for the design, procurement, warehousing, merchandising, and vending of items of apparel and various 
                            trinkets to the hash. Prior flea market or circus midway experience preferred.</p>
                        <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Beermeister : </h2>
                        <p class="text-white-50">This is unquestionably the most important position in the hash. The Beermeister has the weighty responsibility 
                            of making sure that the lifeblood of hashing is available at each and every hash event. He keeps constant vigilance to find the cheapest 
                            spirituous fermenti available, always has coolers in the trunk of his car, cases of beer in his garage, and reliably returns the empty keg 
                            to get another full one for the next hash. While this might be a “pain in the ass” job, it’s undoubtedly the most important one to the hash.</p>
                        <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Hash Cash</h2>
                        <p class="text-white-50">The holder of the purse-strings. Someone needs to dash about the start of each hash begging for money. Someone has 
                            to keep track of what comes in and what goes out (commonly referred to as “the old in and out.”) These generally unappreciated duties fall 
                            on the shoulders of the Hash Cash. This trustworthy soul must withstand the whining of the Hares who have overspent, the whimpering of those 
                            who forgot their fees, and the interrogations of those who mistakenly think there should be some sort of accounting for hash funds.</p>
