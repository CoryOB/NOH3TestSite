                            And some dogs came by car.<br>
                            <br>
                            Once they were assembled,<br>

                            Each dog took off his asshole,<br>
                            And hung it on a hook.<br>
                            <br>
                            After they had been seated,<br>
                            Each mother, son, and sire,<br>
                            Some dirty little mongrel<br>
                            Stood up and shouted, “FIRE!”<br>
                            <br>
                            They rushed out in a panic,<br>

                            And each dog grabbed an asshole,<br>
                            Off of the nearest hook.<br>
                            <br>
                            So if your little Fido,<br>
                            Must strain and strain to shit,<br>
                            The only explanation,<br>
                            His asshole does not fit.<br>
                            <br>
                            And that sir is the reason,<br>
                            A dog will leave his bone,<br>
                            To sniff another dog’s asshole,<br>
                            To see if its his own.<br>
                            <br>

                            She went to Arabia,<br>
