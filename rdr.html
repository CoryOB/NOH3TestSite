                            <p class="mb-0">Every year on the second Saturday in August, the New Orleans Hash House Harriers (a local "drinking club with a running problem")
                                host Red Dress Run, a charity "run" in the Crescent City. The run usually begins in the French Quarter or Marigny neighborhoods of New 
                                Orleans, although the exact location is only announced to those who registered. The runners, with drinks in hand, continue their route thought the 
                                French Quarter and spend the rest of the day celebrating. Expect a sea of red throughout the neighborhood! Even if running isn't you thing, head 
                                down in red to get in on the fun. Participants in the Red Dress Run can sign up <a href="registration.html">HERE</a>. Registration includes donations 
                                to local charities, special live music and beers for the run. Early bird pricing is available. You must be 21 or older to participate.

                            <p class="mb-0">The Red Dress Run is a global phenomenon within the hashing community, characterized by hashers donning red dresses or red-themed 
                                attire for a fun and memorable run. The tradition started in 1987 during a run organized by the San Diego Hash House Harriers. A hasher named 
                                Dudley "Duchess of Pork" Levell accidentally wore a red dress and embraced the opportunity, sparking the idea for future Red Dress Runs. Since 
                                then, Red Dress Runs have spread across the world, with hash groups organizing their own events. One of the most renowned and largest Red Dress 
                                Runs takes place in New Orleans. Organized annually by the New Orleans Hash House Harriers (NOH3), the New Orleans Red Dress Run has become a 
                                beloved tradition. The New Orleans Red Dress Run has been running since its inception in 1987 and draws thousands of participants from all corners 
                                of the globe. Usually held on the second Saturday of August, the event transforms the vibrant streets of New Orleans into a sea of red dresses and 
                                red-themed costumes. The run itself follows a marked trail through the city's energetic neighborhoods, making stops along the way for refreshments, 
                                music, and socializing. After the run, the celebration continues with live music, food, drinks, and entertainment, creating an unforgettable experience 
                                for participants. Apart from the festivities, the New Orleans Red Dress Run also embraces a charitable aspect. Each year, the New Orleans Hash House 
                                Harriers select local charities to support through fundraising efforts during the event. This philanthropic component adds to the sense of community 
                                and giving back that is integral to hashing. The New Orleans Red Dress Run has become an iconic event, combining the rich cultural heritage of New Orleans 
                                with the unique spirit of the Red Dress Run tradition. It captures the essence of hashing: camaraderie, individuality, and a sense of adventure. Participants 
                                from around the world come together to celebrate in a sea of red, making lasting memories while supporting charitable causes. Whether you're a seasoned hasher 
                                or a first-time participant, the New Orleans Red Dress Run offers an extraordinary experience that blends the history and global significance of the Red Dress 
                                Run tradition with the vibrant charm of one of America's most lively cities.
